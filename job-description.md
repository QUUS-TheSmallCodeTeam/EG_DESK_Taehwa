# üíª Electron Developer for Blog Automation App

**Project: eg-desk (Desktop Blog Automation Tool with Claude Code CLI)**

## üßπ Project Snapshot

* **Client**: T Trans (Global Electrical Sensor Manufacturer)
* **App Type**: Electron-based, mainly local environment execution
* **Goal**: Automate bilingual blog content creation, publishing, and SEO
* **AI Integration**: Claude Code CLI (or suggest alternatives)

---

## üè¢ Business Background

T Trans is launching its first WordPress blog to expand into the global market. However, their small marketing team struggles with manual content creation, SEO, and bilingual (Korean-English) publishing. We‚Äôre building a fully local desktop automation tool to streamline this process.

## üì¶ Deliverables

### üìÖ Timeline

* **Phase 1 Duration (Updated)**: 2 weeks total

  * **Demo Day**: August 4th (Monday)
  * üéØ **First Milestone Goal**: Deliver a working pipeline that allows a user to write a blog post (via Claude CLI or input interface) and upload it to WordPress via the REST API. Minimal UI and pipeline.
  * üßë‚Äçüíª **Collaboration Note**: I  will be actively contributing to the project alongside the selected developer and am going to be working on my git repo  for the demo day over this weekend.

### Phase 1 (2 weeks): Blog Automation Core

* Electron-based native desktop UI (cross-platform for macOS and Windows)
* WordPress REST API integration for automated publishing
* Claude CLI-powered terminal for content generation
* Dual-panel layout: WordPress preview (70%) + AI terminal (30%)
* Bilingual content workflows (Korean & English)
* Light grey minimal UI theme, macOS-native titlebar
* Browser automation with Electron `webContents API`

### Phase 2 (Optional - 6 weeks): Full Platform Expansion

* AI chat interface with file upload & conversation memory
* Drag-and-drop content generation from spec sheets
* Claude CLI agents for SEO, content analysis, and deployment
* Local file management with version history
* Multi-tabbed browser system & embedded DevTools

---

## üöÄ Responsibilities

* Build publishing workflow with WordPress REST API
* Implement Claude CLI into a desktop terminal UI
* Create  content creation + SEO tools
* Develop cross-platform native-style UI (macOS & Windows) with resizable panels
* Integrate Electron webContents for in-app browser automation

---

## ‚ú® Expected Skills

* Electron (desktop app development experience)
* Node.js / JavaScript (modern ES6+)
* REST API integration
* HTML/CSS + frontend JS frameworks
* Git (collaborative workflows)

## üî∫ Bonus Skills

## üé® UX & Architectural Philosophy

### 0. EG-Desk Foundation

EG-Desk is a developer-led, AI-integrated desktop platform designed to enable "human-in-the-loop" workflows, combining browser-based environments with agentic automation. It serves as the **foundational architecture** for this blog automation project.

**EG-Desk emphasizes:**

* Embedded Chromium browsers with agent-observable context
* Modular architecture for task-specific automation
* Full local execution (no backend server)
* Agent-driven natural language workflow management
* Deep Claude Code CLI integration for cost-predictable AI ops

This blog automation project for T Trans is a **branching implementation** of EG-Desk, leveraging its structure while narrowing its scope for production delivery.

### 1. Claude Code CLI & Predictable Cost UX

* Claude Code CLI was selected due to its **monthly pricing** model, providing **predictable cost UX** which clients prefer over usage-based models.
* Any AI Agent tools with comparable performance and **monthly-fixed pricing** are welcome. The client avoids unpredictable costs even if the monthly fee is slightly higher.

### 2. Framework Choice Philosophy (Electron vs others)

* T Trans project is based on a **branch from my EG-Desk project**, which is designed for human-in-the-loop AI-agentic workflows with embedded browser capabilities.
* This project is an¬†**experimental and marketing-wise strategic approach**, built on the same principles¬† from eg-desk but scoped for blog automation, thus named Eg-desk\:T trans
* While frameworks like Tauri may offer performance benefits, \*\*UX and extensibility for ultimate eg-desk project goal¬†\*\*is prioritized.
* Many platforms (e.g., Make, Integromat, MCP, etc.) require time to learn, especially for small teams. EG-Desk is structured to **allow natural language-driven automation**.
* AI agents in EG-Desk aim to handle not just workflows, but also **internal tool configurations**, reducing manual setup even on complex platforms.

### 3. Browser Tech & Agent Context Awareness

* We prioritize **human-in-the-loop agent workflows**, where the browser (Chromium-based) is **visible within the app** and **user interaction is trackable**.
* Playwright is under consideration due to its Chromium base, but Electron‚Äôs `webContents` may offer more **real-time context bridging** inside the app. We can freely choose whatever framework we see most optimal.
* In EG-Desk, AI agents will be able to reference user actions and system states.
* While EG-Desk\:T-trans doesn‚Äôt need full agent observation for Phase 1, we'd like to aim for the **system to be modularized** to support those advanced use cases in future expansions. \* Not for demo
* WordPress REST API expertise
* Experience with Claude CLI or similar tools (OpenAI CLI, etc)
* Bilingual localization (KR/EN)
* UI/UX design for native desktop apps
* SEO content automation tools (e.g., meta tag generation)

‚úÖ You are welcome to use any AI IDE or development assistant during this project, such as GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or Claude Workbench.
