## CSS Injection Analysis - Comprehensive Orchestration Plan

### STRATEGIC ANALYSIS PHASE (Parallel Execution)
**Goal**: Find ALL dynamic CSS injection points causing design changes

#### Agent Coordination Strategy:
1. **workspace-manager**: Deep analysis of WorkspaceManager.js - find ALL style injections, createElement('style'), CSS modifications
2. **chat-manager**: Deep analysis of ChatComponent.js - identify style injection points, dynamic CSS changes
3. **state-manager**: Analysis of GlobalStateManager.js and EventBus.js - find any CSS-related state changes
4. **browser-module-maintainer**: Analysis of BrowserTabComponent.js and any browser-related CSS injection
5. **researcher**: Search entire codebase for ALL CSS injection patterns

### EXECUTION SEQUENCE:
**Phase 1**: Parallel comprehensive analysis (ALL agents launch simultaneously)
**Phase 2**: Root cause identification and strategic planning
**Phase 3**: Coordinated fix implementation with specialized agents
**Phase 4**: Integration testing and validation

### EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Complete inventory of dynamic CSS injection points
- Root cause identification of design changes
- Strategic fix plan with component-specific solutions
- Unified CSS approach using index.html classes only

### COORDINATION NOTES:
- All agents report findings to shared scratchpads
- Look for: createElement('style'), style.textContent, innerHTML with styles, programmatic style setting
- Focus on component lifecycle timing issues
- Identify unnecessary vs essential dynamic styles
