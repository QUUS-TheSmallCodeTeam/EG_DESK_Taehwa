## AI Chat Agent Investigation Plan: Model Selection Error Debug

### Task: Add debug logging to identify why model selection fails despite valid API keys

### Investigation Strategy:
1. **LangChainService Debug Logging**
   - Add initialization flow logging
   - Track provider creation and availability
   - Monitor API key loading and validation
   - Log model selection attempts

2. **SecureKeyManager Integration Check**
   - Verify key decryption process
   - Log key availability during service initialization
   - Track timing of key loading vs service initialization

3. **ChatComponent State Debug**
   - Add logging for provider availability updates
   - Track model selection UI state changes
   - Monitor error message triggers

4. **Provider Initialization Flow**
   - Log each step of provider setup
   - Track async initialization completion
   - Monitor error handling during setup

### Expected Outcome:
Clear console logging to identify where the model selection process breaks down.
